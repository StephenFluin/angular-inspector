				<h3>6. Privacy and Use of Data</h3>
				Browser Activity. The Coolbar Pro Browser Extension alerts users when deals, coupons and instant savings are available at a wide variety of Affiliate Stores. When the Extension recognizes available deals it alerts you through your browser. While the Software uses information from your browsing activity to discover and present specific shopping alerts, it does not collect and retain personally identifiable information (unless it is necessary to complete a specific offer, discount or rebate, or display a targeted advertisement). The Coolbar Pro Software is designed to help you benefit from saving and discounts while you shop and relies on recognizing the websites you visit to identify the availability of relevant deals, coupons and comparison shopping results.
				Search Queries. The Coolbar Pro Affiliates Extensions, in the course of processing a given search query, sends a request to our servers. This request includes the keyword query, time of day, browser type, default language setting, IP address, an anonymous unique ID, and a code which identifies the marketing or distribution source of the Extension used by you to conduct your search. If the search query is being generated as the result of a misspelled URL or search term entered in to the browser address bar, we also receive the misspelled URL address or search term. We use this information in order to properly process your search request. For example, this data provides us with: information on which language you prefer to use; aggregated click information for the purpose of ensuring that our search partners are appropriately compensating us; information that allows us to make accurate payments to our distributors; aggregated usage and retention information; and aggregated search query information for the purpose of further monetizing commercially oriented search keywords. All information collected from a search query is recorded on a non-personally identifiable basis and is kept strictly anonymous. The information collected is stored in a query log for up to six months. In addition, all information about search activity is evaluated only on an aggregated basis (except in response to a customer service inquiry or legal process).
				Cookies. The Coolbar Pro Affiliates Extensions also uses “cookies”. We do this for two reasons. First, we use the cookies to store a code designating a marketing or distribution source for the Extension. This information allows us to properly distinguish between Extension versions for purposes of analyzing retention and usage per marketing or distribution source, on an aggregated basis. Second, the Extension uses cookies to ensure that you receive relevant and timely alerts providing deals, coupons, comparison shopping results when available, and to display targeted advertisements to you. Third, the Extension uses cookies to store user preferences. For example, we use a cookie to record which search engine you have selected as your default provider in Coolbar Pro. Upon accessing the search results pages, cookies may also be placed on your computer, to store your use preferences. We do not use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way or to store any personally-identifiable information, and we do not disclose cookie information to third parties (other than as required by legal process). Certain third party partners/service providers may also use cookies in relation to services they provide on or via the Extension. Such third parties’ policies regarding their use of cookies may be found on their respective websites.
				Configuration Requests/Communications with our Servers. The Coolbar Pro Affiliates Extensions sends a configuration request when you start your browser. This request is approximately 5k in size and includes only anonymous data such as IP address, browser type, and information about the specific release date and distribution source of your Extension, as outlined above. In addition, periodically when using the Extension, small communications may be sent to our servers indicating certain user preferences, as outlined above. All such information is anonymous, non-personally identifiable, and is used only for purposes of delivering search and Extension services and content in accordance with your preferences.
				Use of Coolbar Pro Websites Available from the Coolbar Pro Affiliates Extensions. Except as provided for in the relevant privacy policy(ies), we do not collect any personally identifiable information (such as names or email addresses) about you, unless you specifically decide to provide such information (such as by emailing a help request to us or registering for those features requiring or enabling registration).
				If the Coolbar Pro Affiliates Extensions is ever sold or all or substantially all of the assets relating to the Extension and/or associated websites are transferred to another entity, we may transfer all information provided by or collected from you, including personally identifiable information, in order to ensure continuity of your service. We will disclose information, including personally identifiable information, data acquired by cookies, and other data, where required by a subpoena, interception order or other lawful process. We also reserve the right to disclose such information when we believe, in our sole judgment and to the extent consistent with applicable law, that such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or safety of others or to enforce, or protect our rights under, this agreement. If you wish to withdraw your consent to the communication and data usage as described herein, you should uninstall the Coolbar Pro Affiliates Extensions from your computer.
